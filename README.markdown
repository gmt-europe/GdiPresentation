## Introduction

GDI+ Presentation is a highly optimized Windows Forms custom control
implementing a WPF like rendering system. Like WPF, the elements to be
rendered are specified in a declarative way. However, unlike WPF, it is
implemented using GDI+ and is fully compatible with .NET 2.0.

See the demo project for examples of how this component can be used.
